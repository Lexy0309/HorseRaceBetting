      %p
        Dutch betting is a form of gambling where you spread the risk amongst multiple bets in the same
        event/race. If you have the advantage of knowing the statistical probability of an event you can then
        use the Odds associated with the event to minimise your risk whilst maximising your return.

        This method does not mean you should increase your frequency of betting, in fact, you should
        reduce because you are effectively playing twice in the same game.
      %h3 How Dutch betting works.
      %p
        Our calculator is limited to 3 selections. We think, based on mathematics, the return on investment
        is improbable if you select more than this amount of runners.
      %p For example, our tips the next race:
      =image_tag('dutch1.png')
      %p
        From your form analysis in the race you agree that the top selection should be the favourite and that
        you agree Jahez and Rispertta also have a chance of winning. You decide your total bet for this race is $100
      %p Enter $100 into the bank, then enter the odd's for each horse into Selection 1,2 and 3 like so;
      =image_tag('dutch2.png')
      %p
        The calculator will prescribe the bet values to place split from your bank so that you can return a
        minimum percentage of not <120% of your original bank. Therefore spreading your risk and
        increasing your probability â€“ $1.5 is better than zero every day of the week.
      %p In the above example for you $100 you would have returned a total of $490.
      %p As a rule of thumb we suggest betting in races where you believe the top chances 3 are not <$5.
